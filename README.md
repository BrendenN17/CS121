Game works crudely but needs a massive Interface touchup

#TODO
1. Add numbering next to rows and columns
2. Add more descriptive text to users
3. Ensure board placement works properly
   - Test out random placement 
   - For manual placement, show board for every placement & specify exactly why a move is denied
4. Display user board after every turn so user can see User shot board & AI shot board (w/ user ships displayed as well)
   - Rework how ships, hits, misses, water, etc.. are displayed for a more visually appealing game
